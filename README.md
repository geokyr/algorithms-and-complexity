Analytical and Lab Assignments for the [Algorithms and Complexity](https://www.ece.ntua.gr/en/undergraduate/courses/3105) course, during the 7th semester of the School of Electrical and Computer Engineering at the National Technical University of Athens.

## Analytical Assignments

There were 3 analytical assignments for submission and in total the following topics were covered:

- Asymptotic Notation
- Recursive Relations
- Sorting Algorithms
- Greedy Algorithms
- Dynamic Programming
- Graph Algorithms
- Minimum Spanning Tree
- Shortest Paths
- Maximum Flow
- Reductions

## Lab Assignments

There were 3 lab assignments, requiring the implementation and submission of a set of algorithmic problems in C++, with memory and time constraints. These problems required knowledge in the following concepts:

- Data Structures
- Disjoint Sets and Union-Find
- Binary Search
- Combinatorial Optimization
- Two Pointer Technique
- Dynamic Programming
- Greedy Algorithms
- LIS and LDS Algorithms
- Graph Algorithms
- Minimum Spanning Tree
- Shortest Paths
- LCA and RMQ
- Euler Tour
